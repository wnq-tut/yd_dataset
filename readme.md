Two files related to the LSTM model were deleted.

The ark files, which were made by KALDI, can extract the acoustic features from the audio files. To reduce the project size, these files were deleted when uploading to GitHub. The folders involved are feat and over_resampling.

Similarly, HPgroup.exe, which is used for batch editing and generating parameter configuration files, was deleted.

The location for storing the audio database is the folder "yd," and the audio files have been deleted.

The "test_model" folder is used to store the contents of recently developed attention maps. One output has been retained, and the others have been deleted.
